### Kubernetes Components

- **Master Components**
- **Node Components**
- **Addons**

#### Master Components

- Kube-apiserver

- etcd
  Consistent and highly-available key value store used as Lubernetes' backing store all cluster data.

- kube-scheduler
  Component on the master that watches newly created pods that have no node assigned, and selects a node for them to run on.

- kube-contriller-manager

  - Node Controller
  - Replication Controoler
  - Endpoints Controller
  - Service Account and Token Controllers

- cloud-controller-manager

  The following controllers have cloud provider dependencies:

  - Node COntroller
  - Route Controller
  - Service Controller
  - Volume Controller

#### Node Components

- kubelet
  The kubelet does not manage containers which were not created by Kubernetes
- kube-proxy
- Container Runtime
  The Container Runtime is the software taht is responsible for running containers.
  Kubernetes supports several container runtimes: [Docker](http://www.docker.com/), [containerd](https://containerd.io/), [cri-o](https://cri-o.io/), [rktlet](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/rktlet)and any implementation of the [Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface)](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/container-runtime-interface.md).

#### Addons

- Definition: 
  	Addons use Kubernetes resources([DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset), [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/), etc) to implement cluster features.

- Selected addons are described blow:

  - DNS
    All Kubernetes clusters should have [cluster DNS](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/), as many examples rely on it. Cluster DNS is aDNS server, in addition to the other DNS server(s) in your environment, which serves DNS records for Kubernetes services
  - Web UI(Dashboad)
  - Container Resource Monitoring
    Container Resource Monitoring records generic time-series metrics about containes in a central database, and provides a UI for browsing that data.
  - Cluster-level Logging
    A Cluster-level logging mechanism is responsible for saving container logs to central log store with search/browsing interface.
