### Overview

- The **Kubernetes Master** is a collection of three processes that run on a single node in your cluster, which is designated as the master node. Those processes are: [kube-apiserver](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kube-apiserver/), [kube-controller-manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kube-controller-manager/) and [kube-scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kube-scheduler/).
- Each individual non-master node in your cluster runs two processes:
  - **kubelet**, which communicates with the Kubernetes Master.
  - **kube-proxy**, a network proxy which reflects Kubernetes networking services on each node.



### Kubernetes Objects

- The basic Kubernetes objects include:
  - [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/)
  - [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
  - [Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/)
  - [Namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/)
- The higher-level abstractions called **Controllers**. They include:
  - [ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/)
  - [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)
  - [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/)
  - [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/)
  - [Job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/)

### Kubernetes Control Plane

The various parts of he Kubernetes Control Plane, sch as the Kubernetes Master and Kubelet processes, govern how Kubernetes communicates with you cluster. 

The Kubernetes Control Plane maintains a record of  all of Kubernetes Objects in the system and runs *continuous control loops* to manage those objects; state.

#### kubernetes Master

The Kubernetes master is responsible for maintaining the desired state for your cluster.

#### Kubernetes Nodes

The nodes in a cluster are the machines that run your applications and cloud workflows.
