The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot.

### Going back in time

Benefits of container deployment are listed below:

- Agile application creation and deployment
- Continuous development, integration, and deployment
- Dev and Ops separation of concerns
- Observability not only surfaces OS-level information and metrics, but also application health and other signals
- Environmental consistency across development,testing and production
- Cloud and OS distribution portability
- Application-centric management
- Loosely coupled, distributed, elastic, liberated micro-services
- Resource isolation
- Resource utilization

### Why Kubernetes

- **Service discovery and load balancing**
- **Storage orchestration**
- **Automated rollouts and rollbacks**
- **Automatic bin packing**
- **Self-healing**
- **Secret and configuration management**

### What Kubernetes is not



- Additionally, Kubernetes is not a mere orchestration system. In fact, it eliminates the need for orchestration. The technical definition of orchestration is execution of a defined workflow: first do A, then B, then C. In contrast, Kubernetes is comprised of a set of independent, composable control processes that continuously drive the current state towards the provided desired state. It shouldnâ€™t matter how you get from A to C. Centralized control is also not required. This results in a system that is easier to use and more powerful, robust, resilient, and extensible.
