### The Kubernetes API

> Overall API(Application Programming Interface) conventions are described in the [API conventions doc](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md).
>
> API endpoints, resource types and samples are described in [API Reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference).
>
> Remote access to the API is discussed in the [Controlling API Access doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/controlling-access/).

#### What is meaning of API Endpoints

> Details refer to [API Endpoints - What Are They? Why Do They Matter?](https://smartbear.com/learn/performance-monitoring/api-endpoints/)

When an API interacts with another system, the touchpoints of this communication are considered endpoints. For APIs, an endpoint can include a URL of a server or service. Each endpoint is the location from which APIs can access the resources they need to carry out their function.

APIs work using 'requests' and 'responses'. When an API requests information from a web application or web server, it'll receive a response. The place that Apis send requests and where the resource lives, is called an endpoint.

#### Why API Endpoints

Endpoints specify where resources can be accessed by APIs and play a key role in guaranteeing the correct functioning of software that interacts with it.
